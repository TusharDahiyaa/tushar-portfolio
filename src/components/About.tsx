        Right now, I'm diving deep into the coding world as part of the 100xdevs
        Cohort, soaking up knowledge like a sponge. I love that eureka moment
        when everything clicks into place while solving problems.

        adding that extra touch of magic. I'm always on the hunt for new tech to
        explore. Currently, I'm on the lookout for a full-time gig as a

        When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming, binging on movies, or just
        hanging out. Like Curious George, I'm always excited for the next tech
        adventure. üêí‚ú®
